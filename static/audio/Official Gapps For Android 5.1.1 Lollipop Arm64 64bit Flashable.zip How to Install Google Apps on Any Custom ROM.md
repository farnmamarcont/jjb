If you have flashed a custom ROM on your Android device that runs on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop with Arm64 architecture, you may need to install a separate package of Google apps (Gapps) to get access to the Google Play Store and other Google services. Gapps are not included in most custom ROMs due to legal issues, but you can easily download and flash them using a custom recovery.

In this article, we will show you how to download and install the official Gapps package for Android 5.1.1 Lollipop Arm64 devices, which is compatible with most popular custom ROMs such as CyanogenMod, Paranoid Android, SlimKat, and more.
 
## What are Gapps?
 
Gapps are a collection of Google applications and frameworks that are essential for the proper functioning of some apps and features on Android devices. They include the Google Play Store, Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Photos, Google Drive, Google Assistant, and more. They also include the Google Play Services framework, which is required by many third-party apps to access Google APIs and services.
 
Gapps are not part of the Android open source project (AOSP), which means they are not licensed under the same terms as the Android operating system. Therefore, custom ROM developers cannot legally bundle them with their ROMs without obtaining permission from Google. Instead, they provide a separate package of Gapps that users can flash on their devices after installing the custom ROM.

## Why do you need Gapps?
 
If you are using a custom ROM based on AOSP or a stock ROM that does not have Google apps pre-installed, you will need to install Gapps to be able to use the Google Play Store and other Google services on your device. Without Gapps, you will not be able to download and update apps from the Play Store, sync your contacts and calendar with your Google account, use Google Maps and navigation, watch YouTube videos, backup your photos and files to Google Drive, use voice commands with Google Assistant, and more.
 
Some custom ROMs may include some basic Gapps such as the Play Store and Play Services, but they may not include all the other Google apps that you may want or need. In that case, you can install a different variant of Gapps that suits your preferences and needs.
