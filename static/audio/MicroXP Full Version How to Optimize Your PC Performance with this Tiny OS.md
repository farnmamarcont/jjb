# What is MicroXP and Why You Should Try It
 
If you are looking for a lightweight and fast version of Windows XP that can run on old or low-end hardware, you might want to check out MicroXP. MicroXP is a modified version of Windows XP that has been stripped down of many unnecessary components and features, resulting in a much smaller size and faster performance.
 
MicroXP was created by a user named eXPerience, who released several versions of MicroXP and TinyXP over the years. The latest version of MicroXP is v0.82, which was released in 2012. It has a WINDOWS folder that is only 199 MB and a CD size of just 99.9 MB[^1^]. It can be installed in only 5 minutes and 30 seconds[^1^], and it does not require activation.

Despite its small size, MicroXP can run most of the programs and games that you would normally use on Windows XP. It also supports many drivers and devices, such as USB, LAN, WLAN, SATA, sound, video, etc. It has a simple and classic interface that resembles Windows 2000. It also includes some useful tools and tweaks, such as CCleaner, RegShot, nLite, TweakUI, etc.
 
However, MicroXP is not for everyone. It is not suitable for users who need advanced features or security updates from Microsoft. It also lacks some components that may be required by some programs or games, such as DirectX, .NET Framework, Windows Media Player, Internet Explorer, etc. You may need to install these components manually if you encounter any compatibility issues.
 
If you are interested in trying out MicroXP, you can download it from various sources on the internet. One of them is Archive.org[^1^], where you can find the ISO file of MicroXP v0.82 by eXPerience. You can also find other versions of MicroXP and TinyXP by eXPer1ence and other authors on Archive.org[^2^]. You can either burn the ISO file to a CD or use a virtual machine software like VirtualBox to run it.
 
MicroXP is a great alternative to Windows XP for users who want a fast and simple operating system that can run on old or low-end hardware. It may not have all the bells and whistles of Windows XP, but it has enough features and compatibility to satisfy most users. If you are looking for a way to revive your old PC or laptop, give MicroXP a try and see how it works for you.
